## [gene_name]_newick.txt
These files are newick-formatted tree files for orthogroups that contain the gene associated with the gene name in the filename.

DND1 does not have a file because a tree can't be made out of only 3 genes.
## Figure_S2_phylogeny_plotting.R
This file takes the [gene_name]_newick.txt files and creates tree plots.

The tree plots are combined and labels are added at the end.
